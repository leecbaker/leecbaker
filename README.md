### Hi there 👋, I'm Lee!

I'm building software to solve cold cases using DNA at [Othram](https://othram.com). Technology we built has helped solve hundreds of cases, and this is just the beginning.

Here's what we're working on:

- 👨🏻‍💻 Bioinformatics software in Rust/Python
- ☁️ Big data processing in the cloud (AWS • Terraform • Nextflow)
- 💳 A fundraising platform for justice ([DNASolves.com](https://dnasolves.com))
- 📑 Web platforms to streamline solving cases (Python • React • Postgres)
- 🧪 Automation in our state-of-the-art DNA sequencing lab
- 🌱 Many cool problems to solve, and there's always something new to learn!

If this sounds interesting, let's work together! Apply at [othram.com](Othram.com), or [lee@othram.com](mailto:lee@othram.com)
